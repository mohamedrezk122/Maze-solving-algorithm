# Maze-solving-algorithm

In essence, this project is a maze solving algorithm that computes a path (for some algorithms “shortest path”) between two nodes. However , The distinction here is that the maze is just a pic not an array of data or a graph. Simply, the algorithm imports the maze picture then converts it to a minimum spanning tree through a series of steps beginning with assigning nodes and ending with building edges. Now we have a nice tree to implement graph traversing algorithms on like BFS, DFS, A*, etc.
